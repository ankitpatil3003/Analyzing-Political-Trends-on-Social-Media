We're all just trying to live while we enrich someone else. Sure, you might think labor creates no wealth, but we at least run the place while owners profit the most.

Can this be solved by some reform? No. They'll lobby against it. We've seen how far they'll go.

And no, I'm not a Sovietist. Command economics are stupid and unviable. We need a cooperative economy with workers controlling their destinies. Take Mondragon Corporation for example.

So, my fellow shitlibs and cuckservatives, wake up and smell the pain. No more party nonsense. No more neoliberal culture wars. Unite and fight the capitalist goliath.

In the last 8-10years the build up of people being so quick to picking right from wrong has increased to a level I never thought we could reach. Many people have lost touch with thinking for themselves and instead see the world as black and white

I believe many situations triggered this insane division but it appears to me that it became a real problem when Trump ran for office and eventually won in 2016. For the majority of people you either praised Trump as a god or saw him as the worst thing to happen in US history, both sides to this day share the same opinion of bashing anything good he did or exaggerating how amazing he did as a president

Then covid happened which was another massive event that divided people even more and I believe its completely understandable due to the actions that were took. The people who trust their life on leaders had no reason to disagree with many of the questionable actions taken meanwhile the other side couldn't help but believe something was truly off about the whole 'agenda' of covid

As if it couldn't get any worse Russia Vs Ukraine happened which lead to even more division. I side with Ukraine however I know many who don't share that opinion and it becomes an even bigger issue when US and Canadian leaders are sending billions to Ukraine which is a very controversial thing to do when people are struggling living paycheck to paycheck

What even got me to make this post is the most recent event involving Israel and Hamas. I try to keep an open mind on many things and do believe this war was inevitable after both countries being at war for decades. However I cannot wrap my head around the amount of Pro Palestine protests happening right now worldwide but specifically in Canada and USA. I have a problem with anyone who wants war but unfortunately many government and countries can't help themselves due to financial reasons but my main issue is the way Hamas started this war, they committed war crimes and targeted specifically civilians yet people are chanting their names in the streets

As said earlier its not that black and white however its difficult to wrap my head around having over 50% of people in USA or Canada be Pro Palestine to the point of attending protests. Its one thing to be split in the middle after learning about the history of both places but to be 100% in favor of Hamas is absolute madness to me. I personally feel bad for both sides however based on the actions that were taken so far I can't help but be at least 80% on the Israel side even though both sides have many great human beings who don't deserve what is happening

To end it off I really hope people eventually come back to a more stable way of thinking instead of instantly jumping to conclusions. I understand the world has went through a ton of trauma in the last few years which lead to this division but its not a healthy way of moving on to the future",0.86,5,0,5

The vast majority of these are white because that’s who many powerful people, slavers and their customers, want to abuse (e.g. rape and/or injure/torture or poison and/or kill) and partly because there is a large supply of white children and adults that were kidnapped and then groomed for slavery. The number of missing children is very high in USA for several decades. Their children (and grandchildren) were also groomed for slavery and sold worldwide because they would’ve been impregnated at a relatively young age. Many police, military, and federal agencies know about this. Human trafficking is a huge industry worldwide. Some are enslaved and don’t even understand it because they’ve been groomed and that doesn’t always involve sex.

15vub0b,political,Why Vivek is the country’s new hope for change.,"This was also posted on r/PoliticalOpinions

Why I think Vivek is necessary for this country. Give me your thoughts and opinions.

My personal take on GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and why we need him

So I’m sure everyone knows about Vivek, the Republican candidate who has declared his run for the 2024 presidential race. He is an outsider in the political realm since he has no previous experience in government. Up until recently his name was almost unheard of, now his ratings are suddenly rising with the chance of surpassing DeSantis. 

Here are some of my reasons why he is necessary in order to mend the political divide in America and somehow redeem the GOP.

1. Vivek aims to unite the country. Unlike Trump and DeSantis who are egotistical and full of hostility, Vivek presents himself to be a healer and a uniter. In his speeches, he talks about trying to reach out his message to Gen Z people and tries to be an encourager and a positive speaker. Unlike Trump who just talks about national issues, Vivek speaks of revolutionary ideas to try and change the minds of young Americans. He thinks outside the box and has a greater vision as to what is necessary for the entire country. Vivek sounds more of a motivational speaker rather than a politician who aims to inspire young minds and change hearts. One of wisdom and hope. His personal quote that stood out to me was, “We have obsessed over our diversity, while forgetting we are all the same as Americans.”

2. He is one of the few GOP members that are not white, he is of Indian descent. If a POC Republican candidate can win the primaries, it proves that the Republican Party is changing and evolving. It will not just be “the party of white people”, it will be the party that is more accepting and tolerant of diversity. The GOP won’t just be a party of Evangelical Christians anymore, it would also be open to one of a different religion. If Vivek were to win the presidential primaries, we might see one of the biggest party switches in our lifetime. The voting pattern could be altered significantly with Vivek. Many people of color and registered Democrats will give the vote to Vivek. Just a side note, I have seen many comments on YouTube about democrats and people unaffiliated with the GOP who are considering voting for Vivek. Many of those who don’t normally vote Republican are making Vivek the exception. Additionally, he has campaigned in areas that most Republican candidates would not even think of going such as south side Chicago and Philadelphia. He has spoken to MSNBC, a liberal centric news media. He has the potential to lead a victory landslide, similar to what we saw in the 2008 election with Obama.

3. He has the potential to rebrand the Republican Party. With Vivek as a GOP candidate, we might see a split between “Vivek Republicans” and MAGA Republicans. Vivek Republicans could potentially be the less extreme and moderate conservatives who don’t believe in wild conspiracy theories. Vivek has the chance to redeem the GOP from Trump’s absurd cultism and extremism.

4. He is highly articulate, more so than the presidential candidates that we have had over the past two elections. He has unique and revolutionary ideas such as having a civics test for voting and eliminating useless bureaucracy.

5. He is one of the youngest presidential candidates, aside from JFK. Leaders of a nation need young and brilliant minds. Older presidents tend to have outdated opinions that do not resonate with the times.

6. Vivek is a political outsider. Although it seems like a bad thing since he has no experience, it’s the exact opposite. The political world every so often needs someone from outside the circle to influence politics with bright, innovative ideas and a new way of thinking. If someone from inside the political world cannot come up with anything new or innovative, it’s time to search outside. The 2016 election with Trump is the case in point example. Trump was a political outsider who had never-before-heard ideas and a rhetoric that voters were not used to. His innovative ideas are what caused people to vote for him since they were tired of the unoriginal ideas that career politicians have.

Overall, Vivek is the revolutionary president this country desperately needs right now in a time of political polarization and division. Although he won’t solve all problems, he has the potential to at least unite the country.

What do you guys think? Does he have a chance to win the GOP primary? Or will he get demolished by DeSantis and Trump in the debates?

Update: On MSNBC, when Symone told Vivek he is running as a Republican nominee for presidency, Vivek interrupted and stated that he is not running for a political party, he is running to lead the United States of America. This shows he cares more about the entire country as a whole, rather than just one party.",0.29,0,0,0

The biggest share of the funding went to NY, which is a long, long way for the border and barely gets any border crosser compared to the 2 to 4 MILLION that have crossed over the past 2 years.

149hcke,political,Right-wing groups in the US,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want to emphasize right at the beginning that I am from Europe, so I don't know the political situation in the USA that well. If I state something in the comment that is not correct, feel free to correct me.

What I would like to discuss are right-wing groups in the US. I am interested in politics in Europe and the USA, and I am currently studying right-wing groups. It is not about scientific study, but about personal familiarization with politics in different countries.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Blood&amp;Honour is a popular group in Europe. Very little is known about this group. I know some general details, but something more, such as the number of members, is well hidden. Whenever I asked which country has the most members of this group, they told me the USA. I did a little research on the internet and didn't come across much information. As far as I understand, Blood&amp;Honour branches in the US are linked to Volksfront (inactive) and Vinlanders Social Club operating in Florida (source: [www.splcentre.org](https://www.splcentre.org/); hate map by state). Does that mean there's only that one group left? If so, then the claim that the Blood&amp;Honour branch is the largest in the US is incorrect?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What is a bit strange to me is the number of members at the marches of neo-Nazis/white nationalists/Ku Klux Klan and other related groups. At most protests I've seen online, the number of participants is between 50 and 100, which is very small if the number of hate groups is taken as credible. How is it possible that so few members gather at the protests, and on the Internet you can find information about tens or hundreds of such groups in one country? Something is not right there. Either the organizers intentionally go out with such a small number of protesters, or they have a very poor organization in the sense that they do not have communication and cooperation with the same or related branches/groups in other cities and countries, or the information on the Internet is exaggerated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In this regard, I would like to ask a few questions.

What are the most massive right-wing protests in the USA since 1945, in which city were they held and how many participants took part in them? It would be good if you could list the top five biggest ones.

Is the American militia movement connected to any white or other racial movements?

Which countries are hotbeds of the Neo-Nazi/White Nationalist/Ku Klux Klan and related groups?

Does the Northwest dominate in leading such movements, especially when it comes to neo-Nazi movements? I think the Ku Klux Klan still has the strongest foothold in the South, as the most remaining Klans are in Tennessee, 3 Klans out of 11 total.

The Imperial Klans of America is mentioned as the second largest Klan in the country. What was the first largest Klan?

In which country are held the largest number of concerts of music associated with these movements?

What is the difference between Ku Klux Klan and white nationalist groups? I guess white nationalists don't observe the rituals and traditions that the Klan has and therefore don't consider themselves the Klan, even though both groups have very similar ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In a recent statement to construction workers, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his desire to spend time in his woodshop with his kids while simultaneously lecturing about the satisfaction of building ""things."" This has sparked discussion and raised concerns about a potential disconnect between his words and actions. Join the conversation to share your perspectives and thoughts on this matter.

PM Trudeau's statement to construction workers has garnered attention and generated debate, as it brings to light a potential disparity between his words and actions. On one hand, he expresses a personal interest in spending time in his woodshop with his children, emphasizing the value of hands-on creation. On the other hand, he lectures about the satisfaction of building ""things"" in a broader context.

This contradiction has left many questioning the authenticity of the Prime Minister's statements and whether they align with his actions and policies. Some argue that it highlights a lack of consistency or disconnect between his personal interests and his role as a leader.",0.75,6,0,6

17i7yuc,moderatepolitics,What Does A Shooting Cost And Who Should Pay For It?,"  
This is an article I wrote in March of 2021 in Boulder CO, my home. That week we suffered a mass shooting. My logic can easily be transferred to the tragedy today. I felt it was worth it to post it and discuss. 

  
As usual these sorts of tragedies are followed by discussions about PREVENTION and JUSTICE. Will the man be brought to justice? How will we prevent this in the future? These are important discussions, but rarely discussed is DAMAGES. That is what I have to add to the cacophony of opinions on social media. How can damages be used to fight gun violence?

  
THE COST OF GUN VIOLENCE  
Let us start by surveying the damages. 10 people are dead. 11 lives destroyed, if you include the shooter. What is the cost of 11 lives? For starters with an average life expectancy of 79 in the US, that is a loss of 382 years. For reference, 382 years ago it was 1639. 

  
That is 382 years of holidays, family events, and laughs with friends. 300 years of raising children and being a grand parent. What is it worth for a 5 year old to have his parent back? Loss of dollars is trivial compared to these things. That doesn't mean the loss of money isn't immense. 

  
\- If the shooter and victims had worked to an age of 65 that is 475,836 hours of lost labor. The average wage in the US is $27 an hour. So that is $12.85 million.

  
\- It costs roughly 100k to put someone through K12. That is a total of $1.21 million of public money. 

  
\- How much did it cost to call SWAT, the FBI, the ATF, the Boulder Police, and all the other relevant agencies? SWAT costs around $4k an hour. 

  
\- How much to prosecute the shooter? They say the case will take at least a year. Lawyers are not cheap. 

  
\- It costs $40k dollars per year to incarcerate someone. That is $2.32 million for the remainder of the shooter's life.  

  
\- $120k to cremate and bury 10 people. 

  
\- The cost of therapy for the survivors and the victim's families is around $100-200 an hour. 

  
\- How much does it cost to close King Soopers for 5-10 days while they process the crime scene? While they clean the brains out of the dairy section? It costs something like 120k to 500k a week. 

  
The cost is enormous. The Center for Homicide estimates it costs $17.25 million per gun murder. That means, this shooter, in 40 minutes, did the equivalent of blowing up an 11 story building in Denver. 

  
There are around 14,000 gun homicides in the US per year. This does not include accidents and suicides. That is $241.5 billion of losses per year or $735.83 per year per American -- the equivalent of a stimulus check. 

  
WHO SHOULD PAY FOR IT?  
Gun companies know that when a community suffers gun violence, usually gun sales go up. Concealed weapons permits go up. People respond to the lack of security by trying to buy security. This in turn increases the chance of more gun violence incidents. A concealed permit holder gets drunk or mad. A disgruntled teen takes his dad's gun to school. Gun companies know about this and it works for them. Violence begets violence. Profits beget profits.   


I have seen a Glock that advertises a fingerprint proof special coating – a feature only a criminal would find useful. Apparently, they have little accountability for the safety of their products. 

  
The 2nd amendment makes it near impossible to ban guns. So I ask you the following: is the left using all of its tools? If they could save even one person what could they do? 

  
A POSSIBLE SOLUTION  
This is a half measure, but what if every time there is a cost to the public caused by gun violence, the US makes the gun companies pay for it? Every gun manufacturer would take ownership of the gun that they sold. It is debatable how much they should pay for but the US could start with a small fund. They could start by covering funerals and support for dependents? 

Republicans say the market should solve its own problems? Well here it is -- a market solution. 

  
If it did pass, maybe gun companies try to make their products more safe. It could mean that semi-automatic assault weapons aren't profitable. Perhaps they add in a free gun safe with the purchase of a new gun. Companies might only sell guns with tech that codes the gun to the user's grip. Heck, they might even stop making Glocks that have a fingerprint proof coating. Who knows what they might do to reduce the cost, when your cost becomes theirs. Maybe it means guns get more expensive and less people buy them -- maybe not. But at the very least, those who suffer are covered financially.   

  
What is the collective cost of selling guns and who should pay for it? We're paying for it with our lives, our sense of security, and our tax dollars, shouldn't the death mongers pay their share too?",0.26,0,0,0

So an unelected candidate  in the primary..who is even not running in the primary is somehow placed on the general election ballot. i could not find the NH election law that addresses and supports this method of getting a presidential candidate on the ballot. 

Would like to read it if someone has a link. 

Again, it sounds like the dnc is discouraging primaries...very odd. Why would they do this? Because my first impression is they are disenfranchising voters

 On October 24, 2023, the Democratic National Committee’s Rules &amp; Bylaws Committee issued guidance **urging Democratic campaigns to refrain from placing candidates’ names on the ballot,”** wrote Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez in a letter obtained by The Hill to state Democratic Party Chair Raymond Buckley. 

 “In accordance with this guidance, Biden for President will refrain from submitting a Declaration of Candidacy for the Primary ahead of Friday’s candidate filing deadline for the Primary,” she added, noting that B**iden’s name would have his name would appear on the general election ballot in the state.**
